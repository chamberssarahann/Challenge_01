# <Horiseon-refactoring>

## Description

- Make code more accessible, and easier for others to collaborate on
- There was a lot of duplicate code, and it was not meeting accessibiltiy standards
- Now others can jump in and more easily interpret which elements are which so that they can continue improving it as accessibility standards change, or as new features are needed
- I learned a lot about debugging, testing, and proper project management as the refactoring project was sometimes overwhelming
